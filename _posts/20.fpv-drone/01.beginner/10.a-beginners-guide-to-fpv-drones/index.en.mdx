  This beginner's guide is arguably one of the best because it comes from a beginner. I write as I go.
  I couldn't explain anything I'm a pro at better, because I've forgotten what's easy and what's hard while my FPV journey is still fresh.
  I also remember the unpatience "just let me fly already" feeling, so I'll keep it short and sweet.

## Intro I cannot skip

Flying an FPV drone is a lot like learning to play a musical instrument: it requires a lot of time and dedication, and the learning curve is steep.
Sometimes, learning to fly involves repeating the same exercise over and over again, with full focus and attention to every mistake.
At other times, it's "noodling" — just flying aimlessly or improvising as you go.
Sometimes it's a state of flow — you are just flying, having no idea how.

### Quality over Quantity

One fully focused session advances your progress way farther than hours of mindless flying. Mindless flying could also solidify bad habits, that would be hard to unlearn.

### Quantity over Quality

Enjoy every moment of your new hobby, repeating exercises with clenched teeth will suck the soul out of it. Fly mindlessly, crash, have fun.
Turn it into a leisure activity, practice often, it's not a chore.

### The state of gear

Prepare to be frustrated, the quality of most FPV gear isn't great. Gear might be broken from the start, break after a few uses, or just not work with the rest of your setup.
Crashes are inevitable, so even the best gear is going to break. Sometimes parts don't work together, often extensive tuning is required.

Soldering is one of the basic skills you'll need (good news: it's not hard at all).

That said, flying an FPV drone (or just flying) is one of the most rewarding experiences you can have.

<TLDR title='Dive into the Sky' />

- Fly 5-10 hours in [Liftoff®: Micro Drones simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1432320/Liftoff_Micro_Drones/) using a gamepad.
- Borrow or [buy a transmitter](/posts/01.beginner/30.choosing-transmitter/index.mdx) and continue practicing in the simulator.
- [Buy a Tiny Whoop](/posts/01.beginner/40.1001-reason-to-tiny-whoop/index.mdx) and a pair of cheap used goggles.
- Crash 100 times before investing in a more expensive gear.
- Personalize your drone by tuning flight controller and modding / repairing.
- Join your local FPV community.
- At this point, you'll know what to do next.

## Start with a Simulator, aim for a Tiny Whoop

Before rushing to buy any gear, try a simulator first. Piloting an FPV drone isn't easy for most people.
Start with a simulator, or you will hurt someone, and break your gear.
You might lose interest after 10-30 hours in a simulator, which could save you from spending on expensive gear and the time it takes to set everything up.

I've seen some people advise against using a gamepad for piloting, but I started with a PlayStation controller connected to a PC, and it worked out fine for me.
Especially if you are a seasoned gamer, no need to discard your years of experience. The transition to a real transmitter will be just fine.

I recommend everyone to [start with a Tiny Whoop](/posts/01.beginner/40.1001-reason-to-tiny-whoop/index.mdx) and I will die on this hill.
Considering this, [Liftoff®: Micro Drones](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1432320/Liftoff_Micro_Drones/) is an excellent choice.
The experience it offers is close enough to flying a real drone. This simulator will help you choose your first Tiny Whoop drone.
Whether it's 65mm, 75mm, or 85mm, 1S or 2S, bi-blades or tri-blades — there's a lot to consider.
(Don't forget to check out the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1432320/workshop/) for community-made drone models).
The game is available on PC, macOS, Linux, and SteamOS. Network multiplayer allows you to fly with friends or compete with experienced strangers.

Try whatever is available. I haven't tried [Tiny Whoop GO (Games Online)](https://tinywhoopgo.com/), but it's free.
Maybe there's something included in PlayStation Plus or Xbox Game Pass — go for it.

There are plenty of other simulators, [Drone Champions League released its official Game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/964570/DCL__The_Game/), and even though it could get you qualified for a real-life drone racing event, I still recommend to start with TinyWhoop.

## Continue with a Real Transmitter

One of the options at this point, is to buy an RTF (Ready-To-Fly) kit: a drone, a transmitter, and a pair of goggles in one box.

The next step is to pilot [using a real transmitter](/posts/01.beginner/30.choosing-transmitter/index.mdx).

## Choosing a Tiny Whoop

There is a lot to consider, and it's all about personal preference. I can only guide you with questions and personal experience.

## Budget & Fun!

There are decent drones and kits aimed for beginners, they could be cheaper and / or more durable, often easier to start with. Problem is, one overgrows them fairly quickly, and they become boring.
Of course, 'fairly quickly' could be months if you're not flying often.

My budget was tight, so I went straight for a used Mobula7 and I love it. (I was also considering Meteor 75, but the second-hand market is limiting, Mobula came first).
On the downside, I had spent at least 20 hours (a few weekends and evenings) in Betaflight, ESC configurator, and Edge TX, before I could fly it. On the upside, I learned a lot, and I tuned mine to my liking.

### Cinamatic vs Racing & Freestyle

Anything able to shoot a decent footage is at least twise as expensive, learning to fly on it is riskier. On the other hand, buying something cheaper and then upgrading bears its own costs <nobr>¯\_(ツ)\_/¯</nobr>.
I went for the cheapest used Eachine EV800 googles (analog VTX), and I'm OK with it. I can not record my flights, the signal strength is far from great, and the image is not the best, but I fly a real drone.
People new to FPV often ask if analog is that bad and should they go straight for digital — "it depends, and I know the answer for myself now."

### Two-blade vs Three-blade propellers

Two-blade propellers are more efficient, they have dymamic response — better acceleration and max speed. In theory, they provide longer flight time.
Three-blade propellers provide better grip, enabling sharper turns and better control with less inertia.

### Frame size: 65mm vs 75mm vs 85mm

This is where simulators shine. You can try different drones without buying. The frame size is more about the fill: maneurability, speed, acceleration, flight time — everything comes to play at once, and it's hard to describe.

I would go with 65mm for **indoors**, but I don't fly indoors because drones (even tiny ones) are loud, and I have a small kid. On the other hand, rain (even a drizzle), or a mild wind makes outdoors flying impossible — something to consider.
75mm feel great **outdoors**, and I was able to tame it indoors, especially with motors locked at 70% throttle.

85mm is the same as 3-inch, so it's like a toothpick with prop guards. It is powerful but more heavy.

### Battery size: 1S vs 2S

I was thinking that battery size affects the flight time, boy was I wrong.
First of all, the battery size affects the weight, so inertia and maneurability. Second, the weight affects the flight time (smaller battery could provide longer flight time due to its weight).
But most of all, the battery size affects the power output, so the speed and acceleration. With the real drone, throttle is never truly linear. With some batteries, you give the full throttle, and they lag, with others, they give power instantly but have a noticeable sag afterwards.
So again, it's more about the feel, but in this case, simulators show only a part of the picture.

### Types of FPV Drones

**Tiny Whoops**: Small, agile drones perfect for indoor flying and beginners.
**Cinewhoops**: Slightly larger, designed for capturing smooth, cinematic footage.
**Racing Drones**: Built for speed and agility, used in FPV racing.
**Freestyle Drones**: Optimized for acrobatics and creative flying styles.

### Types of FPV Kits

#### RTF (Ready-To-Fly)

Description: RTF kits are the most user-friendly option, coming fully assembled and with everything you need to start flying right out of the box. This includes the drone, a transmitter (remote controller), batteries, and often a charger. The drone is pre-configured, so you won't need to bind the transmitter or install any components before your first flight.
**Ideal For**: Beginners or those looking for a hassle-free entry into FPV flying, as well as experienced pilots who prefer not to deal with assembly or configuration processes.

Getting Started with FPV

Start with a Tiny Whoop or a beginner-friendly RTF (Ready-To-Fly) kit. These are less expensive and more durable, ideal for learning the basics.

Understanding the Gear:

Drone: The vehicle you'll be flying, equipped with motors, ESCs (Electronic Speed Controllers), a flight controller, and an FPV camera.
Transmitter (Radio Controller): The handheld device used to control the drone.
Goggles: The headset that provides the FPV feed from the drone's camera.
Batteries: FPV drones typically use LiPo (Lithium Polymer) batteries.

Basic Flight Concepts
Throttle Control: Controls the altitude of your drone. More throttle lifts the drone, less throttle lowers it.

Safety and Regulations
Know the Rules:

Always be aware of your local regulations regarding drone flying. This may include no-fly zones, altitude limits, and registration requirements.

Safety First:

Never fly near people, private property, or sensitive areas.

Always keep your drone within line of sight, unless using FPV goggles under specific conditions allowed by regulations.

Maintenance and Troubleshooting

Regular Checks:

Before each flight, check your drone for any loose parts or damage.

Ensure your batteries are charged and stored safely.

Learning Repairs:

Crashes are part of the learning process. Learning to repair your drone is an invaluable skill in the FPV world.

Joining the Community

Connect with Others:

The FPV community is vast and welcoming. Join online forums, social media groups, and local flying clubs to learn from experienced pilots and stay updated on the latest in FPV.
Practice and Patience
Take Your Time:

Mastery takes time and practice. Start with basic maneuvers and gradually progress to more complex flights.
Enjoy the Journey:

FPV flying is not just about the destination but the thrill of the flight. Enjoy every moment, from the first hover to acrobatic flips.
FPV drones offer a unique and immersive flying experience, blending the lines between technology, sport, and art. Welcome to the world of FPV flying—your adventure begins now!
