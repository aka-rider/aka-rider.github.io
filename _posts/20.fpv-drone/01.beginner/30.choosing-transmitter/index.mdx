<TLDR title='I use Radiomaster Zorro (ExpressLRS)' />

- I used to gamepad (thumber üëç)
- I don't need an overwhelming number of switches; my go-to's are arm, mode, beeper, and turtle
- I fly one quad
- I'm a regular in the simulator (Bluetooth, baby - no wires attached!)
- 2 hours of flying is plenty
- I don't need a fancy screen (I'm wearing goggles anyway)

## Compatibility

Make sure the protocol lines up so your Transmitter (TX) and your drone can bind.

## Ergonomics

Regardless of what you're flying, the controller in your hands can make or break the experience.
However, trying to find the perfect transmitter right from the start can be challenging.
You might not realize what suits you best until you've experimented with a few.
Everyone's hands and preferences are different - long sticks or short sticks, no resistance or tactile feedback, switches, sliders, or buttons, and so forth.

### Pinchersü´∞ vs Thumbers üëç.

There's no right or wrong way to hold your transmitter; it's all about what works for you.
Personally, I prefer thumbing. Pinching just ends up with my fingers fighting each other, and I get tired more quickly.

## Range and Signal Strength

<TLDR title='It depends ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I fly with 50mW TX' />

There's a dependency between range and signal strength (which also impacts battery life). Although, it's not a linear relationship, and numerous factors are at play.
Direct Line of Sight (LOS) is the most significant factor. The more obstacles, the more the signal will degrade.
Interference from electrical lines, Wi-Fi, other pilots, and even the weather can impact your signal.

On the example of ExpressLRS, they've got a [leaderboard](https://www.expresslrs.org/info/long-range/)

The current (Mar 2024) records are:

| Max Dist. | Freq | Pkt Rate | TX Power | Type |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | -------- | ---- |
| 31.56km   | 2.4G | 50Hz     | 50mW     | Wing |
| ...       | ...  | ...      | ...      | ...  |
| 10Km      | 2.4G | 500Hz    | 10mW     | Quad |

This is an extreme example, but it's an indicator of what's possible.

For ExpressLRS, the 100mW TX (with a good antenna) should be more than enough, the video feed will likely become the limiting factor earlier.

## Number of channels

When choosing a transmitter, consider the number of channels it supports.
More channels mean more functions you can control on your drone, from the basics like throttle, pitch, and yaw, to extras like camera tilt and lights.

## Module Expansion Bay

A module bay enables the addition of another protocol, frequency, or increased power to your transmitter.
It's essential to verify that the module is not only compatible with your transmitter but also fits properly within the module bay.

## External Antenna Support

An external antenna can significantly improve your transmitter's range and signal strength.

## Telemetry capabilities

Telemetry allows your drone to send real-time data back to your transmitter, like battery voltage, signal strength, and GPS position.
If you plan to use telemetry in real-time, a big bright screen definitely won't hurt. But I have no idea how to use it simultaneously with FPV goggles.

## FPV simulator support (Joystick mode)

This feature lets you use your transmitter as a joystick, providing a seamless transition from virtual to real-world flying.
It's a fantastic way to practice without risking your drone.
